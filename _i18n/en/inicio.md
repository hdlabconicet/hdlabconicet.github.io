The Digital Humanities constitute a scientific field at the crossroads of research in the Humanities and the approaches, tools and resources of Computer Science and Information Science. 

HD LAB is the first research space in Digital Humanities in Argentina that combines the organizational and collaborative model of laboratory for the development of research projects for multiple audiences, inside and outside academia, proposing an approach to the Humanities from technology and the principles of Open Science.

The research line in Digital Humanities started at CONICET at the end of 2014 with an Institutional Project called Methodologies in Digital Tools for Research in Social Sciences and Humanities (MheDI), between the Institute of Bibliographic Research and Textual Criticism (IIBICRIT-CONICET) and the Argentine Center for Scientific and Technological Information (CAICYT-CONICET), and today it is developed in the HD LAB from IIBICRIT contemplating the following areas of interest:
