Digital Scholarly Editing is one of the most representative areas within the field of Digital Humanities. Since early days, initiatives like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) have considered how to approach the digitization of texts in the Humanities not only as static resources for consultation, but also as enriched and searchable texts. 

All the digital editions in our **Digital Library** follow the XML-TEI standard and the principles of minimal computing, favoring the use of open technologies, governance over data and code, and the reduction of computing infrastructure. The enriched texts with notes and maps are complemented with data visualizations and many distant reading resources. The digital editions are published on a rolling basis with ISSN 3072-7715.
